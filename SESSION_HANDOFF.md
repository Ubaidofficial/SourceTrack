## Session 102.5 — Export & Share Scope Security Hardening

**Date:** 2026-06-04 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Surgical Export Route Hardening** — Confirmed that the `/api/export` router is mounted with site membership authentication middleware (`requireUserAuth, validateSiteKey, requireSiteMembership`) in `api/index.js`. Integrated `getSupabaseAdmin` inside `api/routes/export.js` to query saved reports strictly filtered by both `id` (the client-provided `report_id`) and `site_id` (the backend-resolved `req.site.id`), ensuring that cross-site report lookups fail with a 404/403.
2. **Override Protections on Public Token Route** — Updated `GET /api/public/:token` inside `api/routes/public-dashboard.js` to check for and reject (`400 Bad Request`) any query or body scope override attempts (`site_key`, `site_id`, `siteKey`, `siteId`). This guarantees that only the site context matching the cryptographically verified token is queried.
3. **Sensitive Key Check in CSVs** — Confirmed that the `escapeCsv` builder in `api/routes/export.js` only exports aggregated metric columns returned by `getFlexibleReport` (sources, campaign dimensions, etc.), ensuring no raw identifiers (like order IDs, phone numbers, emails, tokens, or customer IDs) are included.

### Files changed
- `api/routes/export.js` — Secure middleware chain, `report_id` verification, parameter fallback mapping.
- `api/routes/public-dashboard.js` — Scope override checks on the public token GET handler.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.6** — Agency Layout Client/Site Switcher Dropdown.

## Session 102.4 — Conversion Deduplication UI Visibility

**Date:** 2026-06-04 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **In-Memory Deduplication Logging** — Declared a Map `dedupeEventsLog` and implemented the `getDedupeSummary(siteId)` metrics builder in `api/routes/conversion.js`. When a duplicate conversion is skipped (based on `order_id`), it logs the timestamp and key type (`order_id` or `derived`).
2. **Secure Summary Endpoint** — Added `GET /api/events/dedupe-summary` in `api/routes/events.js`. The route is secured with both `validateSiteKey` and `requireSiteMembership` to verify authenticated site access.
3. **Event Debugger Integration** — Updated `dashboard/src/pages/EventDebugger.jsx` to fetch deduplication metrics in parallel during the main data fetch. Added the Conversion Deduplication summary card rendering status metrics and warning parameters gracefully without exposing any raw customer identifiers.

### Files changed
- `api/routes/conversion.js` — Logged duplicate events and exported `getDedupeSummary`.
- `api/routes/events.js` — Implemented the secure `/dedupe-summary` endpoint route handler.
- `dashboard/src/pages/EventDebugger.jsx` — Fetched and displayed the Conversion Deduplication card.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.5** — Export & Share Scope Security Hardening.

## Session 102.3 — SourceTrack Doctor (Phase 1)

**Date:** 2026-06-04 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Real-time Diagnostic Endpoint** — Implemented `GET /api/dashboard/tracking-health?site_key=...` in `api/routes/dashboard.js`. Queries the database directly to prevent cache lag, derives tracking health states (`healthy`, `warning`, `critical`, `pending`, `unknown`), and strips `www.` prefixes to normalize domains accurately.
2. **Dashboard Doctor Card** — Integrated `/tracking-health` with React Query and rendered the doctor panel card in `dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`. Shows statuses, detailed checks, event metadata, and quick action links ("Try Again", "Event Logger", "View Snippet").
3. **Validation & Trailing Whitespace Cleanup** — Resolved all trailing whitespaces identified by `git diff --check`, verified full build compilation of frontend assets, and validated routes syntax.

### Files changed
- `api/routes/dashboard.js` — Added the tracking-health endpoint route handler.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — Fetched and rendered the tracking health Doctor card/panel.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.4** — Conversion Deduplication UI Visibility.

## Session 102.2 — Ingest-Side PII URL/Referrer Redaction

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Shared Redaction Utilities** — Implemented and exported `redactPiiFromUrl` and `redactPiiFromObject` in `api/lib/utils.js`.
   - Sanitizes common sensitive query parameter values (emails, phones, passwords, auth tokens, invite codes) in URLs/referrers to `REDACTED` while keeping UTM tags and click-IDs fully intact.
   - Handles relative URLs gracefully and implements regex fallbacks for parsing safety.
   - Allows targeted key-based URL/referrer property redaction in custom payload objects without modifying regular traits/identifiers.
2. **Ingest Sanitize Interceptors** — Updated Express API controllers:
   - `api/routes/track.js` — Sanitizes `req.body.page_url`, `req.body.referrer`, and `req.body.properties` before they are sent to PostHog, written to webhook targets, or persisted to telemetry tables.
   - `api/routes/conversion.js` — Sanitizes `req.body.page_url`, `req.body.referrer`, and `req.body.properties` before PostHog dispatch, webhook broadcast, and external CAPI target fan-outs.
   - `api/routes/identify.js` — Sanitizes `req.body.traits` (redacting specific keys like `page_url`, `referrer`, `landing_page` if present, without altering identity tokens or identifiers).
3. **Manual Unit Verification** — Added a dedicated local validation script verifying all parameters behave correctly, relative paths parse safely, and invalid strings do not throw exceptions.

### Files changed
- `api/lib/utils.js` — Added `redactPiiFromUrl` and `redactPiiFromObject`.
- `api/routes/track.js` — Intercepted track and collect routes to redact parameters.
- `api/routes/conversion.js` — Intercepted conversion payloads to redact parameters.
- `api/routes/identify.js` — Sanitized specific URL fields inside traits.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.3** — SourceTrack Doctor & Tracking Health Alerts.

## Session 102.1 — Snippet Installation Verification Assistant

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Direct Telemetry Metadata Update** — Added a throttled, non-blocking telemetry metadata update helper to `api/routes/track.js` and `api/routes/conversion.js`. This writes the `last_seen_at` and `onboarding_state` directly to the `sites` table upon successful event ingestion, eliminating the need to query the database repeatedly.
2. **Supabase Verification Endpoint** — Rewrote the `/api/install/status` endpoint in `api/routes/install.js` to directly read the lightweight telemetry data from the `sites` table instead of relying on slow/failing PostHog `queryHogQL` calls.
3. **Domain Validation & Enhanced UI** — The `/status` endpoint now correctly verifies if an event came from a different domain. Updated `dashboard/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` to parse and render these specific verification states (`wrong_domain`, `wrong_site_key`, `api_failed`) directly in the UI.

### Files changed
- `api/middleware/auth.js` — Appended telemetry fields to the site cache layer.
- `api/routes/track.js` — Throttled metadata writes.
- `api/routes/conversion.js` — Throttled metadata writes.
- `api/routes/install.js` — Rewritten verification querying Supabase.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` — Handled new states (`wrong_domain`, `wrong_site_key`, `api_failed`) and stopped polling efficiently.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.2** — SourceTrack Doctor & Tracking Health Alerts.

## Session 101.6 — Dashboard Optional Data Fallback Polish

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Graceful Optional Data Fallbacks** — Hardened the error pathways of `/api/dashboard/cac` and `/api/campaign-costs` GET routes. Instead of crashing or returning a hard HTTP 500 error when Supabase queries fail (e.g., if database tables are temporarily offline or missing), the API endpoints now return a status 200 with custom fallback object shapes wrapping an empty results array and a clear `_unavailable` flag.
2. **Graceful Frontend Fallback Extraction** — Updated the `useQuery` parser for `cacData` inside `Dashboard.jsx` to recognize the nested fallback wrapper using:
   `const cacResults = Array.isArray(cacData) ? cacData : (cacData?.results || [])`
   `const cacUnavailable = cacData?.cac_unavailable || false`
3. **Graceful UI Rendering for Unavailable States** — Integrated the `cacUnavailable` status into the dashboard UI:
   - **Avg CAC Tile**: Renders an amber "Unavailable" text block with a "spend data unavailable" details hint when spend calculations fail.
   - **Attribution Table**: Renders "Unavailable" in place of numeric/missing strings under the CAC and Payback columns.
   - **Insights & Alerts Board**: Automatically appends warning cards if analytics or spend data is unavailable.

### Files changed
- `api/routes/dashboard.js` — Graceful catch block fallback inside the `/cac` endpoint.
- `api/routes/campaign-costs.js` — Graceful catch block fallback inside the GET `/` endpoint.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — Handled `cacUnavailable` conditional rendering in Avg CAC metric tile, sources table columns, and insights panel.

## Session 101.5 — SEO, Sitemap, Robots, and Use-Cases Footer Cleanup

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Sitemap and Robots Configuration** — Created a comprehensive `sitemap.xml` listing all 12 public marketing pages with their priorities. Removed the `/report-builder` path block from `robots.txt` since it serves a public marketing gate for anonymous users.
2. **Auth Indexability Protection** — Added `/login`, `/signup`, and `/auth/callback` to the disallow rules in `robots.txt` and verified that they have `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />` set inside their `<Helmet>` blocks.
3. **Footer Redirect Link Cleanup** — Updated links in the use cases column of the footer (`MarketingFooter.jsx`) to point directly to the canonical solution URLs rather than old redirected use case routes.

### Files changed
- `dashboard/public/sitemap.xml` — Included all 12 public marketing page URLs.
- `dashboard/public/robots.txt` — Removed `/report-builder` disallow; added `/login`, `/signup`, and `/auth/callback` disallows.
- `dashboard/src/components/MarketingFooter.jsx` — Updated use case links directly to canonical routes.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 102.1** — Pending future directives from developer.

## Session 101.4B — Legacy Attribution Date-Range Touchpoint Truncation Fix

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Date-Range Truncation Bug Fixed** — Refactored legacy attribution functions (`lastTouchAttribution`, `firstTouchNonDirectAttribution`, and `lastTouchNonDirectAttribution`) in `api/lib/attribution-engine.js` to look up pageview touchpoints across all time (without a lower-bound date restriction) up to each conversion event's timestamp. This resolves the issue of misattributing historical touchpoints as `direct / none` when the pageview happened before the report window.

### Files changed
- `api/lib/attribution-engine.js` — Restructured subqueries to LEFT JOIN pageviews with `pv.timestamp <= e_inner.timestamp` and group by the unique conversion UUID `conversion_uuid` instead of `distinct_id`.


---

## Session 101.4A — Tracker Conversion Payload Parity

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Tracker Conversion Payload Parity** — Added `ref_param`, `source_param`, and `via_param` to the conversion payload in `tracker/tracker.js` so that they align with the fields sent by pageview events. Rebuilt `tracker/tracker.min.js`.

### Files changed
- `tracker/tracker.js` — Appended `ref_param`, `source_param`, and `via_param` properties to the conversion event payload.
- `tracker/tracker.min.js` — Rebuilt the minified tracker script.


---

## Session 101.3 — Tracker Build Pipeline and Documentation Domains

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Tracker Build Script Cleaned** — Removed `esbuild tracker/loader.js` step from `build:tracker` in `package.json` and successfully rebuilt `tracker/tracker.min.js`.
2. **Stale Domain References Replaced** — Replaced all instances of stale `https://api.sourcetrack.ai` domain with the correct ingestion and tracker domain `https://api.srctk.com` in:
   - `dashboard/src/pages/Docs.jsx`
   - `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionEcommerce.jsx`
   - `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionAgency.jsx`
   - `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionSaaS.jsx`
   - Comment in `api/routes/proxy.js`

### Files changed
- `package.json` — Cleaned `build:tracker` script by removing the missing `tracker/loader.js` reference.
- `tracker/tracker.min.js` — Rebuilt the minified tracker script.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Docs.jsx` — Updated code examples, URL base variables, and curl instructions to use the live domain.
- `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionEcommerce.jsx` — Fixed domain inside code block snippet.
- `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionAgency.jsx` — Fixed domain inside code block snippet.
- `dashboard/src/pages/SolutionSaaS.jsx` — Fixed domain inside code block snippet.
- `api/routes/proxy.js` — Updated domain reference in comments.

## Session 101.2 — Onboarding Back-Step Saving & Resume Snippet Stabilization

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Onboarding Back-Step saving fixed** — Adjusted step transition checks in backend `/api/onboarding/update` to permit saving previous steps (`targetStep <= currentStep`). Removed the deletion of user selections (`business_type`, `install_method`, `selected_conversions`) on back-steps to prevent onboarding data loss.
2. **Stepper progress preserved** — Configured database `current_step` tracking to store the maximum reached progress step, keeping completed steps clickable in the stepper even when users temporarily step backward to correct options.
3. **On-mount snippet resume fixed** — Updated the `loadOnboardingStatus()` mount logic in `Onboarding.jsx` to fetch the script snippet (or fallback to local template) when users resume onboarding at step 4 or later, eliminating the "Loading script..." freeze.

### Files changed
- `api/routes/onboarding.js` — Relaxed back-step saves, prevented data-loss deletion, and preserved maximum stepper progress.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` — Added on-mount snippet fetching for resumed steps >= 4.

## Session 101.1 — Fix frontend API bypasses

**Date:** 2026-06-03 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **Stripe Billing / checkout bypasses fixed** — Modified `Billing.jsx` to use central `createCheckout` and `getBillingPortal` helpers from `lib/api.js` instead of raw fetches to relative `/api/billing/...` routes.
2. **GDPR / Settings bypasses fixed** — Replaced raw `fetch('/api/gdpr/...')` calls with `fetchApi` calls for retention policy updates, visitor erasure, and account deletion in `Settings.jsx`.
3. **Data Quality bypass fixed** — Replaced raw `/api/jobs/data-quality-check` POST with `fetchApi` in `DataQuality.jsx`.
4. **Stripe helpers alignment** — Standardized `createCheckout` and `getBillingPortal` in `lib/api.js` to execute correct POST requests with normalized body attributes (`plan` and `returnUrl`) matching the backend routes.

### Files changed
- `dashboard/src/lib/api.js` — Resolved body fields for Stripe helpers and enhanced `fetchApi` to handle flat JSON structures.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Billing.jsx` — Replaced raw checkout and portal calls with `createCheckout` and `getBillingPortal` helpers.
- `dashboard/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — Swapped raw GDPR endpoint calls with unified `fetchApi` helper.
- `dashboard/src/pages/DataQuality.jsx` — Configured manual check triggers via `fetchApi` helper.

### Next Session Plan
- **Session 101.2** — Stabilize Onboarding stepper progression (fix back-navigation 400 error and script snippet load on resuming).

## Session 98 — Beta QA: Auth → Onboarding → Tracker → Dashboard Flow

**Date:** 2026-05-23 | **Branch:** `main` | **Build:** ✅ passing

### Completed

1. **OAuth callback** — AuthCallback redirects instead of spinner forever.
2. **Onboarding UX** — Removed Watch Video, added Log out, verification non-blocking, Continue to Dashboard with state persistence.
3. **API domain** — Dashboard reads `VITE_API_URL`/`VITE_TRACKER_BASE_URL`/`VITE_FRONTEND_URL` env vars.
4. **Tracker QA** — Confirmed pageview + conversion ingest, UTM/click-id capture, first-touch attribution.
5. **Onboarding completion** — No longer requires PostHog script detection. Requires site + business_type + install_method. Stores verification_status in onboarding_state.
6. **CORS fix** — Global OPTIONS middleware before auth. Hardcoded dashboard origins. OPTIONS returns 204.
7. **Install verification hardening** — /install/status returns safe pending response on PostHog failure. validateSiteKey returns 401 not 500.

### Files changed
- `api/index.js` — CORS preflight middleware, hardcoded origins
- `api/middleware/auth.js` — OPTIONS guard, catch returns 401 not 500
- `api/middleware/user-auth.js` — OPTIONS guard
- `api/routes/install.js` — PostHog failure returns safe pending response
- `api/routes/onboarding.js` — Removed PostHog verification block, store verification_status
- `dashboard/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx` — Non-blocking verification, Continue to Dashboard with state persistence
- `dashboard/src/pages/AuthCallback.jsx` — Redirect fix

### Remaining QA (manual browser verification needed)
- Continue to Dashboard after failed verification → should complete and navigate
- `/dashboard` loads
- Refresh `/dashboard` stays on dashboard (no redirect to onboarding)
- `/api/onboarding/me` returns `onboarding_completed: true`

### Deployment note
- Railway Dashboard deploy may fail with `##NOT-AUTHORIZED##`. Fix: reconnect GitHub repo access.

### Verification commands
```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS "https://api.srctk.com/api/onboarding/complete" -H "Origin: https://www.sourcetrack.ai" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: authorization,content-type"
curl -i https://api.srctk.com/health
